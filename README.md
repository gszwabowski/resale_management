Online Marketplace Inventory Management w/ Selenium

## Description

This GitHub repository houses Jupyter notebooks that will allow a user to automate repetitive tasks when selling on online marketplaces that do not have in-depth/bulk inventory management tools. eBay does a great job at bulk inventory management, however, sites like Mercari, Depop, Poshmark, etc. only allow inventory management on an item-by-item basis. While easy to use, handling items individually is time consuming. Thus, I have developed a method of automating these repetitive tasks (e.g. bulk price drops, item promotion, sending offers to potential customers) using Selenium to interface with a webdriver.

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

* Python libraries: selenium, bs4, pandas, undetected_chromedriver, asyncio

## Usage

Open a marketplace's notebook and change the 'username' and 'password' strings to your username and password. Running various code blocks will log you in and allow you to obtain your inventory and do things like drop prices or send offers.
